The classification is outlined in Annex VIII of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and Annex IX of the In-vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR). Understanding the classification rules is essential for manufacturers as it impacts the conformity assessment procedures and the involvement of Notified Bodies.

# The classification criteria for medical devices under the MDR are as follows:

|Class|Description|
|---|---|
|Class I|These devices present the lowest risk and include non-invasive and non-active devices. They are subject to the general safety and performance requirements outlined in Annex of the MDR. Class I devices do not require the involvement of a Notified Body for conformity assessment; and manufacturers can self-certify their compliance.|
|Class Is|This subcategory includes sterile medical devices in Class I. The same general safety and performance requirements apply, but since sterility is involved, the Notified Body's involvement is required for conformity assessment.|
|Class IIa|Devices in this class pose a slightly higher risk than Class I and include products like hearing aids and certain types of catheters. Manufacturers must involve a Notified Body for conformity assessment under this classification.|
|Class IIb|Devices in this class present a moderate level of risk and include products such as infusion pumps and X-ray machines. Conformity assessment requires the intervention of a Notified Body.|
|Class III|This classification applies to high-risk devices, including implants and life-sustaining equipment. Class III devices undergo the most stringent conformity assessment; and manufacturers must involve a Notified Body.|
# Classification Criteria for In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices

Under the IVDR, the classification criteria for in-vitro diagnostic devices are based on similar risk considerations:

# List A

In-vitro diagnostic devices in this list pose the lowest risk and are subject to the general safety and performance requirements in Annex of the IVDR. Manufacturers can self-certify these devices without the involvement of a Notified Body:

# List B

Devices in this list have a higher risk profile than List A and require Notified Body involvement in conformity assessment:

# List C

This classification includes devices used for self-testing or near-patient testing; and they must undergo a more rigorous conformity assessment involving a Notified Body:

# List D

In-vitro diagnostic devices in this list pose the highest risk and include devices intended for diagnosing serious infectious diseases or assessing compatibility for blood transfusions. Class D devices require the most comprehensive conformity assessment and involvement of a Notified Body.

# Official Documents

# Special Considerations for In-vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDs)

# A. Unique Regulatory Requirements for IVDs

In-vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) play a crucial role in healthcare by providing valuable information about a patient's health status based on laboratory analysis of biological samples. Due to their unique nature and potential impact on patient care, IVDs have specific regulatory requirements within the European Union. Manufacturers of IVDs should be aware of the following considerations:

# 1. Risk Classification:

IVDs are classified into four risk classes (Class A to D) based on the potential risks they pose to patients and users. The classification determines the conformity assessment route and the involvement of Notified Bodies.

# 2. Classification Rules:

The classification rules for IVDs are different from those for other medical devices. They consider factors such as whether the device is self-testing, whether it provides critical information for immediate patient management decisions, and whether it's intended for near-patient testing. To access the detailed classification rules for IVDs, you can refer to Annex VIII of the IVDR directly. The IVDR is available on the official website of the European Union: In-vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) (Regulation (EU) 2017/746).

Annex VIII of the IVDR provides an extensive list of corresponding classification rules, ranging from Class A IVD categories (lowest risk) to Class D (highest risk). The classification is based on factors such as invasiveness, duration of use, whether the device is intended for self-testing, and whether it provides information for immediate patient management decisions. Manufacturers must carefully assess their IVDs against these classification rules to determine the appropriate class and the conformity assessment procedures required for market access within the EU.
# Common Technical Specifications (CTS):

The European Commission may issue Common Technical Specifications for specific types of IVDs, establishing common performance and safety requirements:

# A. Companion Diagnostics:

IVDs that are specifically intended to be used with a particular medicinal product to identify suitable patients for treatment may be classified as companion diagnostics and have specific regulatory requirements.

# B. Performance Evaluation and Clinical Performance Studies

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of IVDs is paramount to guarantee patient safety and deliver precise diagnostic results. Manufacturers must conduct performance evaluation and clinical performance studies to demonstrate the clinical validity and utility of their IVDs. Key considerations include:

# Analytical Performance:

Assess the analytical performance characteristics of the IVD, such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, through robust analytical studies.

# Clinical Performance:

Conduct clinical performance studies to evaluate the IVD's diagnostic accuracy and its ability to provide reliable results for specific medical conditions.

# Clinical Evidence:

Gather clinical data from performance studies and relevant scientific literature to demonstrate the IVD's clinical validity, clinical sensitivity, and clinical specificity.

# Informed Consent:

Obtain appropriate informed consent from study participants, ensuring ethical considerations are met throughout the clinical evaluation process.

# Post-Market Surveillance:

Continuous post-market surveillance is essential for IVDs to monitor performance and safety during real-world use. Implement vigilance systems to report and investigate adverse events.

# Notified Body Involvement:

Depending on the classification and risk class of the IVD, Notified Body involvement may be required for the evaluation of technical documentation and clinical data.

# Performance Evaluation Report:

Compile all relevant data and findings into a comprehensive Performance Evaluation Report, which serves as crucial documentation for conformity assessment.

Compliance with these special considerations for IVDs is critical for manufacturers seeking to sell their diagnostic devices in the European Union. By meeting the specific regulatory requirements and providing robust clinical evidence, manufacturers can ensure that their IVDs deliver accurate and reliable results, thus contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficacy.
