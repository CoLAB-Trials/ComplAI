# Introduction

The sponsor of a clinical investigation is required to submit an application/notification1 to the Member State(s) in which a clinical investigation is to be conducted, accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex XV of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR)2. The application/notification is required to be submitted by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 73 of the MDR.

In the absence of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), a series of clinical investigation application/notification documents have been created to support clinical investigation procedures with respect to MDR.

These documents include:

- Clinical investigation – application/notification form under the MDR
- Addendum to the clinical investigation application/notification form for:
- Additional investigational device(s) (section 3)
- Additional comparator device(s) (section 4)
- Additional investigation site(s) (section 5)
- Clinical investigation supporting documents - Appendix of documents to attach
- Checklist of general safety and performance requirements, Standards, common specifications and scientific advice

Insofar as possible, the clinical investigation application/notification form includes same data fields to the EUDAMED system in development.

For further guidance with respect to the application of certain MDR provisions during the absence of EUDAMED please see MDCG 2021-1 Rev.13. In the absence of EUDAMED, the Union-wide unique single identification number for a clinical investigation, which shall be used for all relevant communication in relation to that clinical investigation will be the CIV-ID which is currently used for Eudamed2, the electronic system which supports the medical device Directives4.

# Use of templates

These documents are intended to be facilitative and their use by the Competent Authorities and sponsors is encouraged, however it is important to check with the individual Member State in which the clinical investigation is planned to be conducted as to any specific national requirements. It is planned that these templates will be withdrawn once the EUDAMED module for clinical investigations is fully functional. Further operational guidance with respect to the use of the guidance may be provided in due course.

1 Clinical investigation application (MDR Art. 62(1)), PMCF investigation notification (MDR Art. 74(1)), other clinical investigation application/notification, i.e. a national application (MDR Art. 82(1)).
