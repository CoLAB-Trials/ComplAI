The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumer's Directorate B, Unit B2, which focuses on "Cosmetics and medical devices," has released a guidance document on the classification of medical devices titled MEDDEV 2.4/1 Rev. 9, dated June 2010. This document provides guidelines related to the application of the Council Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices. It is part of a set of guidelines addressing questions regarding the application of EU Directives on medical devices. The guidelines are not legally binding, as only the European Court of Justice has the authority to interpret Community Law conclusively. The document offers guidance on the application of classification rules for medical devices as specified in Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC, as amended. National Competent Authorities and national Courts are responsible for making legally binding decisions on a case-by-case basis. Directive 93/42/EEC, as amended, allows for exceptions from the classification rules outlined in its Annex IX, considering technical progress or information obtained from post-market experience with the device. (Official Journal L 169, 12.7.1993, page 1.)

This MEDDEV has been revised after consultation with various interested parties (e.g. Competent Authorities, Commission services, industry, and other stakeholders) and therefore this document reflects a consensus view on the classification of medical devices. Active implantable medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices are covered by separate Directives, which do not apply the classification rules reviewed in this MEDDEV. Note: This document is a revision of an earlier document published in July 2001 as MEDDEV 2.4/1 rev 8. It includes information pertaining to the changes in classification resulting from the amending and implementing Directives issued since the last revision of this document in 2001, including derogation of the classification rules in the case of breast implants and hip, knee, and shoulder joint replacements and requirements related to devices containing human blood derivatives and medical devices manufactured utilizing tissues of animal origin. In addition, this guidance document takes account of the changes arising from Directive 2007/47/EC^2 which further amends Directive 93/42/EEC and became applicable as from 21st March 2010. ^2OJ L 247, 21.9.2007, p. 21

The concept of “significant changes” includes changes in the nature, level, and density of energy (see Rule 9). This means that for instance, an electrode is not an active device under this classification system as long as the energy input is intended to be the same as the energy output. For instance, resistance in a wire that causes minor changes between input and output cannot be considered to constitute "significant change". However, electrodes used in electrosurgery for cutting tissues or cauterisation are active devices because their operation depends on energy provided by a generator and their action is achieved by conversion of energy at the interface between the device and the tissue or in the tissue. Electrodes intended for E.C.G. or E.E.G are normally not active devices because they do not normally act by conversion of energy. However, it should be understood that an electrode, which is an accessory of an active implant, is covered under the relevant Directive for active implants. Further information on this issue can be found in “Guidelines relating to the application of the Council Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices”. The application of energy from the human body does not make a device “active” unless that energy is stored within the device for subsequent release. For instance, energy generated by human muscle and applied to the plunger of a syringe (thus causing a substance to be delivered to a patient) does not make this syringe an “active device”. However, if a drug delivery system depends upon manual winding to preload a spring which is subsequently released to deliver a substance, then the device incorporating the spring is an “active device”. Medical devices using prestored gases and/or vacuum as a power source are regarded as active devices, e.g. gas mixers with anaesthesia machines and gas powered suction pumps. Heating/cooling pads intended only to release stored thermal energy are not active devices because they do not act by conversion of energy. However, heating/cooling pads which act by chemical action (e.g. endothermic or exothermic reaction) are active devices as they are converting chemical energy into heat energy and or vice versa. Radioactive sources that are intended to deliver ionising radiation are regarded as active medical devices, unless they are radiopharmaceuticals as defined in article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC or radioactive implants as defined in article 1 of Directive 90/385/EEC. Further information on devices with a measuring function can be found in MEDDEV 2.1/5. Information about procedure packs is available in the linked guidelines. 

Procedure packs per Article 12 of Directive 93/42/EEC normally do not require classification as each device in the procedure pack keeps its own CE marking and classification. However, in cases where the procedure pack incorporates devices which do not bear a CE marking, or where the chosen combination of devices is not compatible in view of their original intended use, the system or procedure pack shall be treated as a device in its own right and as such be subjected to the relevant procedure pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 93/42/EEC. For a procedure pack that is a device in its own right, the classification is normally determined by the intended use. In those cases where the intended use of the procedure pack is not specific enough to determine the classification, the classification of the pack is at the level of the highest classified device included in the pack, where applicable taking into account the new intended use of the device. 

3.2. Application of the classification rules In terms of further interpretation of the classification rules, the following should be considered: It is the intended purpose that determines the class of the device and not the particular technical characteristics of the device, unless these have a direct bearing on the intended purpose. e.g. incorporation of an ancillary substance, tissue of animal origin etc. It is the intended and not the accidental use of the device that determines the class of the device. For instance, a suture organizer, that is intended to keep order of suture threads used in open heart surgery, should not be considered as an invasive device if in the normal use it can be kept outside the patient. Similarly, if a medical practitioner uses the device in a manner not intended by the manufacturer, this does not change the class of the device for the purpose of conformity assessment. However, if the normal clinical use of the device changes in time with evolving clinical practice such that the intended purpose and classification of the device changes this should be addressed by the manufacturer and the conformity of the device assessed for the new intended purpose. It is the intended purpose assigned by the manufacturer to the device that determines the class of the device and not the class assigned to other similar products. For instance, two sutures that have the same composition may well have different intended purposes. As an alternative to classifying the system as a whole, the determination of the class of a particular device may be made with respect to the simplest configuration that can still be considered, in view of its proper functional features, as a device in its own right. A device that is part of a system, e.g. a tube in an extra corporeal circulation set, may be classed as a device in its own right rather than classifying the system as a whole. The device, however, must be CE marked in its own right as a separate device in such instances.

Similarly, combination devices with parts that have different functional purposes may be analyzed separately with respect to each of these parts. For instance, a drainage device will have an invasive tube and a non-invasive collection device. These components may be classified separately, provided that they are also CE marked separately. Accessories are classified in their own right separately from the device with which they are used (Annex IX Section 2.2 of Directive 93/42/EEC). If a given device can be classified according to several rules, then the highest possible class applies. For instance, a wound dressing incorporating collagen is covered by rules 4 (Class I, Class IIa or Class IIb depending on intended use) and 17 (Class III). All rules must be considered, for instance if an active device is also surgically invasive, the relevant rules for surgically invasive devices must also be considered. If the device is not intended to be used solely or principally in a specific part of the body, it must be considered and classified on the basis of the most critical specified use. Classification of the device will have to be determined on the basis of claims contained in the information provided with the device. The manufacturer must be sufficiently specific in that regard. If the manufacturer wants to avoid the particular higher classification, then it must clearly define on the labelling the intended purpose in such a way that the device falls into the lower class. The manufacturer must provide as a minimum requirement either appropriate positive or negative indications for use. For a device to be "specifically intended" for the purpose referenced in a particular classification rule, the manufacturer must clearly indicate that the device is intended for such a specific purpose in the information accompanying the device. Otherwise it is deemed to have the intended use which is principally used and accepted in general medical practice. Multi-application equipment such as laser printers and identification cameras, which may be used in combination with medical devices, are not medical devices unless their manufacturer places them on the market with specific intended purpose as medical devices. Due to its complexity, classification of standalone software will be covered in a specific guidance document. 3.3. How to use the rules. The manufacturer must take into consideration all the rules in order to establish the proper classification for its device. It is quite conceivable for instance that one of the general rules that are not specific to active devices, nevertheless applies to such a device. All the device characteristics must be taken into consideration. The characteristic or combination of characteristics in accordance with the intended purpose of the device that rates the highest class determines the class for the device as a whole. By derogation to the classification rules set out in Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC, the manufacturers must also take account of additional Directives which may affect the classification of their device or the conformity route to be followed.

Directive 2003/12/EC on the reclassification of breast implants in the framework of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices. Directive 2005/50/EC on the reclassification of hip, knee and shoulder joint replacements in the framework of Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices. Directive 2003/32/EC introducing detailed specifications as regards the requirements laid down in Council Directive 93/42/EEC with respect to medical devices manufactured utilising tissues of animal origin. 3.4. Practical example A simple wound drainage device has three components that must be taken into consideration: the cannula, the tubing and the collector unit. If the device is sold without a cannula, then the classification of the cannula does not need to be taken into account. It is assumed here that the device is used for short-term duration, i.e. that uninterrupted intended use is more than 60 minutes and less than 30 days. It is furthermore assumed that the collected liquids are not intended to be re-infused into the body nor reprocessed for eventual re-infusion and that the device is not intended to be connected to a powered suction system. Intended uses include a surgically invasive cannula to reach a wound site in the pleural cavity to drain the cavity, which falls under Rule 7 and Class IIa, non-invasive tubing to evacuate body liquids towards the collector, which falls under Rule 1 and Class I, and a non-invasive collector to receive the body liquids, which also falls under Rule 1 and Class I. The clear conclusion here is that the manufacturer would have a choice of applying Class II A to the whole device or carrying out separate conformity assessment procedures for the cannula on one hand and the tubing and collector on the other hand. 3.5. Handling of interpretational problems.

In case the manufacturer is unsure how its devices should be classified, it should first consult a Notified Body. In case doubts remain or there is a disagreement with the Notified Body, the relevant Competent Authority (i.e., the Competent Authority to which the notified body is subject) should be approached in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 93/42/EEC. In addition, Directive 93/42/EEC provides Community wide mechanisms, including a committee procedure, to address problems related to classification. Complex classification issues may be referred to the ‘Borderline and Classification Medical Devices Expert Group’ for resolution. Consensus positions on classification reached by this Expert Group are published for reference in the Manual on Borderline and Classification¹⁰. In addition, MEDDEV 2.1/3 rev 3¹¹ provides with useful information relating to devices incorporating, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product or a human blood derivative, and which is liable to act on the human body with action ancillary to that of the devices. ¹⁰ http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/medical-devices/documents/borderline/index_en.htm ¹¹ http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/medical-devices/files/meddev/2_1_3_rev_3-12_2009_en.pdf

The explanations of individual rules are presented as follows: This section begins with a graphical summary of the rules, providing a preface to subsections on the individual rules. Each subsection starts with a general explanation of the rule, followed by a tabular presentation of the rule and examples of devices to which it applies. Any special terms used are explained, and practical issues related to the rule are clarified. It must be emphasized that even if a particular device type is given as an example, this does not mean that such devices are in all cases in the class indicated by the example. It is always possible that some manufacturer will assign to such a device an entirely different intended use than what was used in the context of the example. The graphical summary is a medical devices classification guidance chart for initial identification of probable device class. Note: Always confirm definitive classification by reading all rules in detail, and utilize additional assistance in this guidelines document as provided in the form of general explanations of rules and examples of devices. Subjects include non-invasive devices (Rules 1, 2, 3, 4), invasive devices (Rules 5, 6, 7, 8), active devices (Rules 9, 10, 11, 12), and special rules (Rules 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).

Non-invasive devices are categorized based on their interaction with patients and their intended use. Rule 1 specifies that devices either do not touch the patient or only come into contact with intact skin, classifying them as Class I. According to Rule 2, devices used for channelling or storing substances for eventual administration also fall under Class I. However, if these devices are for use with blood, other body fluids, organs, or tissues, they are classified as Class IIa. Similarly, if the devices may be connected to an active medical device in Class IIa or higher, they are also classified as Class IIa. Rule 3 addresses devices that modify the biological or chemical composition of blood, body liquids, or other liquids intended for infusion, classifying them as Class IIb. If the modification involves only filtration, centrifugation, or the exchange of gas or heat, they are classified as Class IIa. Rule 4 pertains to devices in contact with injured skin for purposes such as mechanical barrier, compression, or absorption of exudates, which are classified as Class I. If the device is intended for wounds that breach the dermis and heal only by secondary intent, it is classified as Class IIb. Devices intended to manage the micro-environment of a wound, along with others, are classified as Class IIa. The information provided is based on data training up to October 2023.

Rule 5 outlines the classification of invasive devices in body orifices or stomas, not through surgical means. For transient use, the device falls under Class I. If the device is intended for short-term use, it is classified as Class IIa. However, if the use is restricted to the oral cavity, ear canal, or nasal cavity, it remains at Class I. For long-term use, the classification is Class IIb, unless the device is only used in the oral cavity, ear canal, or nasal cavity and is not likely to be absorbed by the mucous membrane, in which case it is classified as Class IIa. If the device is connected to an active medical device in Class IIa or higher, it is also classified as Class IIa.

Rule 6 covers surgically invasive devices intended for transient use. These devices fall into different classes based on their specific functions. If they are used to control, diagnose, monitor, or correct a defect in the heart or central circulatory system through direct contact, they are classified as Class III. Devices for use in direct contact with the central nervous system also fall under Class III. Reusable surgical instruments are classified as Class I. If the device supplies energy or ionizing radiation, it falls under Class IIb. Devices that have a biological effect and are mainly or wholly absorbed are also Class IIb. Additionally, devices intended to administer medicines in a potentially hazardous manner are classified as Class IIb. Rule 7 pertains to surgically invasive devices intended for short-term use. These are generally classified as Class IIa. However, if they are used in direct contact with the central nervous system, they are classified as Class III. Devices specifically for monitoring, controlling, diagnosing, or correcting defects of the heart or central circulatory system through direct contact also fall under Class III. Devices that supply energy or ionizing radiation are classified as Class IIb. Devices with a biological effect or that are mainly absorbed are classified as Class III. If the device undergoes a chemical change in the body or is intended to administer medicines (excluding use in teeth), it falls under Class IIb.

Rule 8 addresses surgically invasive, long-term use and implantable devices. These include Class IIb devices unless they are to be placed in teeth, in which case they are classified as IIa. Devices used in direct contact with the heart or central circulatory/nervous system are classified as Class III. Devices that have a biological effect or are mainly absorbed are also Class III, as are devices that undergo chemical change in the body or administer medicines, provided they are not for use in teeth. Specific derogations exist for breast implants and hip, knee, and shoulder joint replacements, which are classified as Class III.

ACTIVE DEVICES Rule 9 Active therapeutic devices intended to administer or exchange energy IIa or Administer or exchange energy in potentially hazardous way IIb or Intended to control or monitor or influence directly the performance of a class IIb active therapeutic device IIb Rule 10 Active device for diagnosis. If intended to supply energy, to image in vivo distribution of radiopharmaceuticals, or for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes IIa or Specifically intended to monitor vital physiological parameters where variations could result in immediate danger IIb or All devices emitting ionizing radiation and intended for diagnostic and therapeutic interventional radiology IIb Rule 11 Active devices to administer or remove medicines & other substances to or from the body IIa or If this is in a potentially hazardous way IIb Rule 12 All other active devices I

Special Rules: Rule 13 pertains to devices incorporating an integral medicinal substance liable to act in an ancillary way on the human body, classified as Class III. Rule 14 involves devices used for contraception or prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, classified as Class IIb, or Class III if implantable or long-term invasive. Rule 15 specifies devices to be used for disinfecting medical devices, classified as Class IIa, or Class IIb if specifically used for disinfecting invasive devices or for disinfecting, cleaning, rinsing, or hydrating contact lenses. Rule 16 relates to devices intended for recording of X-ray diagnostic images, classified as Class IIa. Rule 17 covers devices utilizing non-viable animal tissues or derivatives, except those in contact only with intact skin, classified as Class III. Lastly, Rule 18 is for blood bags, classified as Class IIb.

The section 4.2 General Explanation of Rules/Practical Issues/Examples provides details about Rule 1, which pertains to medical devices that either do not touch the patient or contact only intact skin. This rule functions as a catch-all for any devices not specifically covered by other rules, applying to those that engage only with non-invasive contact or unaffected skin. All such non-invasive devices fall into Class I unless specified otherwise in subsequent rules. Examples of such devices include: body liquid collection devices designed to prevent return flow, like urine collection bottles, ostomy pouches, incontinence pads, or collectors used with wound drainage devices, often connected to patients through catheters and tubing; devices that immobilize or apply force or compression, such as non-sterile dressings used for sprains, plaster of Paris, cervical collars, gravity traction devices, and compression hosiery; devices intended generally for external patient support, like hospital beds, patient hoists, walking aids, wheelchairs, stretchers, and dental patient chairs; corrective glasses and frames; stethoscopes for diagnosis; eye occlusion plasters; incision drapes; conductive gels; non-invasive electrodes such as those for EEG or ECG; image intensifying screens; and permanent magnets for removal of ocular debris.

Practical issues of classification: Some non-invasive devices are indirectly in contact with the body and can influence internal physiological processes by storing, channelling or treating blood, other body liquids or liquids which are returned or infused into the body or by generating energy that is delivered to the body. These must be excluded from the application of this Rule and be handled by another rule because of the hazards inherent in such indirect influence on the body.

Rule 2, which pertains to channelling or storing devices for eventual administration, needs to be considered separately from non-contact devices of Rule 1 due to their indirectly invasive nature. These devices channel or store substances that will eventually be administered into the body, commonly used in applications like transfusion, infusion, extracorporeal circulation, and delivery of anesthetic gases and oxygen. Some devices under this rule are simple, gravity-activated delivery systems. According to Rule 2, all non-invasive devices intended for the channelling or storing of blood, body liquids or tissues, liquids, or gases for eventual infusion, administration, or introduction into the body, are classified as Class IIa if they may be connected to an active medical device in Class IIa or a higher class. Examples include devices such as tubing in active drug delivery systems like those used with infusion pumps, antistatic tubing for anesthesia, anesthesia breathing circuits, pressure indicators, pressure-limiting devices, and syringes for infusion pumps. Devices intended for storing or channelling blood, body liquids, organs, or tissues also fall under Class IIa. These examples include devices for channelling blood in transfusion or extracorporeal circulation, temporary storage or transport containers for organs destined for transplantation, long-term storage containers for biological substances and tissues like corneas or sperm, and fridges specifically for storing blood or tissues. In all other cases, the devices are classified as Class I. These include devices providing a simple channelling function where gravity transports the liquid such as administration sets for infusion and devices used for temporary containment or storage like cups and spoons for administering medicines, as well as syringes without needles. Practical issues of classification include blood bags, which are covered under a separate rule, Rule 18.

If a device, e.g., tubing, can be used for a purpose that would cause it to be connected to an active device, such a device will be automatically in Class IIa, unless the manufacturer clearly states that it should not be connected to an active device of Class IIa or higher. Note 1: "May be connected to an active device". Such a connection is deemed to exist between a non-active device and an active device where the non-active device forms a link in the transfer of the substance between the patient and the active device and the safety and performance of one of the devices is influenced by the other device. For instance, this applies to tubing in an extracorporeal circulation system which is downstream from a blood pump and in the same blood flow circuit, but not directly in contact with the pump.

Rule 3 addresses non-invasive devices that modify the biological or chemical composition of blood, body liquids, or other liquids intended for infusion into the body. These devices differ from non-contact devices of Rule 1 because they are indirectly invasive by altering substances that will eventually be infused into the body. This category includes sophisticated elements of extracorporeal circulation sets, dialysis systems, and autotransfusion systems, as well as devices for the extracorporeal treatment of body fluids, regardless of whether they are immediately reintroduced into the body, even when the patient is not in a closed loop with the device. According to Rule 3, all non-invasive devices intended to modify the biological or chemical composition of blood, body liquids, or other infusion liquids are classified as Class IIb. Examples include devices designed to remove undesirable substances from the blood through solute exchange, such as hemodialysers, devices intended for cell separation by physical means like gradient media for sperm separation, and haemodialysis concentrates. However, if the treatment involves filtration, centrifugation, or the exchange of gas or heat, these devices are classified as Class IIa. Examples in this case include particulate filtration of blood in an extracorporeal circulation system to remove particles and emboli, centrifugation of blood for transfusion or autotransfusion preparation, removal of carbon dioxide or addition of oxygen to the blood, and warming or cooling the blood in an extracorporeal system. These devices are typically used alongside an active medical device regulated under Rule 9 or Rule 11. In the context of this rule, filtration and centrifugation refer exclusively to mechanical methods.

Rule 4 - Non-invasive devices which come into contact with injured skin is designed primarily to cover wound dressings regardless of wound depth. Traditional products, such as those used as a mechanical barrier, are well understood and do not present significant hazards. However, rapid technological advancements have led to new wound dressings with non-traditional claims, such as managing the wound's micro-environment to enhance natural healing. More ambitious claims involve influencing healing mechanisms like granulation or epithelial formation or preventing wound contraction. Some devices may even serve life-sustaining purposes, especially with extensive skin destruction or systemic effects. Dressings with ancillary medicinal products are classified under Class III per Rule 13. According to Rule 4, all non-invasive devices in contact with injured skin are categorized as follows: Class I includes devices intended for mechanical barriers, compression, or absorption of exudates, such as absorbent pads, island dressings, cotton wool, wound strips, adhesive bandages, and gauze dressings that act as barriers, maintain wound position, or absorb wound exudates. Class IIb encompasses devices intended for severe wounds breaching the dermis, where healing is by secondary intent. This includes dressings for chronic ulcerated wounds, severe burns, severe decubitus wounds, and those incorporating tissue augmentation or temporary skin substitutes. Class IIa covers all other cases, such as managing the wound micro-environment, by controlling moisture, regulating humidity, temperature, oxygen, gas levels, pH values, or influencing healing through other physical means. These devices may claim additional healing properties without being for extensive wounds needing secondary intent healing, and include adhesives for topical use.

Polymer film dressings, hydrogel dressings, and non-medicated impregnated gauze dressings present various practical issues of classification. Products covered under this rule are extremely claim sensitive, meaning a polymeric film dressing would be in Class IIa if the intended use is to manage the micro-environment of the wound, or in Class I if its intended use is limited to retaining an invasive cannula at the wound site. Consequently, it is impossible to say a priori that a particular type of dressing is in a given class without knowing its intended use as defined by the manufacturer. However, a claim that the device is interactive or active with respect to the wound healing process usually implies that the device is in Class IIb. Most dressings intended for use in Class IIa or IIb also perform functions that are in Class I, such as serving as a mechanical barrier. Such devices are nevertheless classed according to the intended use in the higher class. For devices incorporating a medicinal product or a human blood derivative, see Rule 13, or for animal tissues or derivatives rendered non-viable, see Rule 17.

In explaining special concepts, a breached dermis refers to a wound that exposes at least partly the subcutaneous tissue. Secondary intent describes a wound healing process where it first fills with granulation tissue, followed by the growth of epithelium over the granulation tissue and wound contraction. In contrast, primary intent involves wound edges being close enough or pulled together, such as through suturing, to allow the wound to heal. Skin may be considered “injured” due to pathological factors like diabetic ulcers or external factors such as burns.

Rule 5 concerns devices that are invasive with respect to body orifices such as the ear, mouth, nose, eye, anus, urethra, and vagina, and emphasizes that these are distinct from devices that penetrate through a cut in body surfaces, known as surgical invasiveness. For short-term use, it is important to differentiate between invasiveness concerning the less vulnerable anterior parts of the ear, mouth, and nose, and other anatomical sites accessible through natural body orifices. A surgically created stoma allowing the evacuation of urine or faeces is also considered a body orifice. Devices falling under this rule are typically diagnostic and therapeutic instruments used in specialties like ENT, ophthalmology, dentistry, proctology, urology, and gynaecology. 

According to Rule 5, all invasive devices with respect to body orifices, other than surgically invasive devices and not intended for connection to an active medical device or intended for connection to an active medical device in Class I, are classified as follows: If intended for transient use, they are in Class I, including devices such as handheld mirrors used in dentistry, dental impression materials, tubes for stomach pumping, impression trays, enema devices, examination gloves, urinary catheters intended for transient use, and prostatic balloon dilation catheters. For short-term use, such devices are in Class IIa, including items like short-term corrective contact lenses, tracheal tubes, stents, vaginal pessaries, and indwelling urinary catheters intended for short-term use, except when used in the oral cavity up to the pharynx, in an ear canal up to the ear drum, or in a nasal cavity, in which case they fall under Class I, such as dressings for nose bleeds and materials for manufacturing dentures.

1. PURPOSE AND PHILOSOPHY OF MEDICAL DEVICE CLASSIFICATION It is not feasible economically nor justifiable in practice to subject all medical devices to the most rigorous conformity assessment procedures available. A graduated system of control is more appropriate. In such a system, the level of control corresponds to the level of potential hazard inherent in the type of device concerned. A medical device classification system is therefore needed, in order to apply to medical devices an appropriate conformity assessment procedure. In order to ensure that conformity assessment under the Medical Device Directive functions effectively, manufacturers should be able to determine the classification of their product as early as possible in device development. It was therefore decided to set up a system of classification rules within the Directive, so that each manufacturer could classify its own devices. The classification of medical devices is a ‘risk based’ system based on the vulnerability of the human body taking account of the potential risks associated with the devices. This approach allows the use of a set of criteria that can be combined in various ways in order to determine classification, e.g., duration of contact with the body, degree of invasiveness and local vs. systemic effect. These criteria can then be applied to a vast range of different medical devices and technologies. These are referred to as the ‘classification rules’ and are set out in Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC. They correspond, to a large extent, to the classification rules established by the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) in the guidance document GHTF/SG1/N15:2006. It is recognized that although the existing rules will adequately classify the vast majority of existing devices, a small number of products may be more difficult to classify. Such cases may in particular include devices which are borderline cases between two different classes of medical devices. In addition there may be devices that cannot be classified by the existing rules because of their unusual nature or situations where the classification would result in the wrong level of conformity assessment in light of the hazard represented by the device (see also section 3.5). 2. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE OF CLASSIFICATION 2.1. General requirements Irrespective of the class of the device, all devices must: - meet the essential requirements, including the requirements regarding the information to be supplied by the manufacturer (Annex I of the Directive 93/42/EEC); - be subject to the reporting requirements under the medical device vigilance system. [Source: http://www.ghtf.org/documents/sg1/SG1-N15-2006-Classification-FINAL.pdf]

Devices are in Class IIb if they are intended for long-term use, such as urethral stents, long-term corrective contact lenses, tracheal cannulae, and urinary catheters intended for long-term use, except if they are used in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx, in an ear canal up to the ear drum or in a nasal cavity and are not liable to be absorbed by the mucous membrane, in which case they are in Class IIa. Examples include orthodontic wires, fixed dental prostheses, and fissures sealants. All invasive devices with respect to body orifices, other than surgically invasive devices, intended for connection to an active medical device in Class IIa or a higher class, are in Class IIa. This includes devices like tracheostomy or tracheal tubes connected to a ventilator, blood oxygen analysers placed under the eyelid, powered nasal irrigators, nasopharyngeal airways, some enteral feeding tubes, fibre optics in endoscopes connected to surgical lasers, suction catheters or tubes for stomach drainage, and dental aspirator tips.

Rule 6 primarily covers three major groups of devices: devices used to create a conduit through the skin (needles, cannulae, etc.), surgical instruments (scalpels, saws, etc.), and various types of catheters, suckers, etc. All surgically invasive devices intended for transient use are in Class IIa unless they fall under specific exceptions. Some examples of such devices include needles used for suturing, needles of syringes, lancets, suckers, single-use scalpels and scalpel blades, support devices in ophthalmic surgery, staplers, surgical swabs, drill bits connected to active devices, surgical gloves, etchants, testers of artificial heart valves, heart valve occluders, sizers, and holders, swabs to sample exudates, and single-use aortic punches. However, devices intended specifically to control, diagnose, monitor, or correct a defect of the heart or central circulatory system through direct contact with these parts of the body are classified as Class III. This includes cardiovascular catheters such as angioplasty balloon catheters and stent delivery catheters/systems, related guidewires, introducers, dedicated disposable cardiovascular surgical instruments, electrophysiological catheters, and electrodes for electrophysiological diagnosis and ablation. Additionally, catheters containing or incorporating sealed radioisotopes, where the radioactive isotope is not intended to be released into the body (if used in the central circulatory system), and distal protection devices fall into this category. Reusable surgical instruments are classified as Class I, which includes scalpels and scalpel handles.

Reamers, drill bits, and saws that are not intended for connection to an active device, as well as retractors like forceps, excavators, and chisels, and sternum retractors for transient use, are typically not classified under the same strict regulations as other devices unless they are intended specifically for use in direct contact with the central nervous system, in which case they are classified as Class III. This includes neuro-endoscopes, brain spatulas, direct stimulation cannulae, spinal cord retractors, and spinal needles. Devices intended to supply energy in the form of ionizing radiation are classified as Class IIb. Catheters containing or incorporating sealed radioisotopes, where the radioactive isotope is not intended to be released into the body, are included in this class if used in the circulatory system, excluding the central circulatory system. Devices intended to have a biological effect or to be wholly or mainly absorbed are classified as Class IIIb. Devices intended to administer medicines by means of a delivery system are classified as Class IIb if this process is potentially hazardous, taking into account the mode of application, such as devices for repeated self-application where dosage levels and the nature of the medicinal product are critical, for example, insulin pens. Explanations of special concepts include Note 1, which defines terms like "surgically invasive device," "central circulatory system," "central nervous system," and "reusable surgical instruments" in Section I of Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC. It is noted that surgical instruments connected to an active device are not considered to be ‘reusable surgical instruments’. Note 2 explains that the expression "correct a defect" does not cover devices used accessorily in heart surgery procedures, such as clamps and aortic punch instruments. The first indent of this rule does not apply to aortic punches and similar cutting instruments which function similarly to a scalpel. Note 3 clarifies that surgical instruments not specifically intended for purposes described in the first indent are classified in class IIa if intended for single use and in class I if they are reusable, regardless of the site of application.

Note 4: Dedicated means that the intended purpose of the device or accessory is to specifically control, diagnose, monitor or correct a defect of the heart or of the central circulatory system. Note 5: Biological effect: All materials and devices have the potential to affect tissues following use in a surgically invasive procedure. A material is considered to have a biological effect if it actively and intentionally induces, alters or prevents a response from the tissues that is mediated by specific reactions at a molecular level. Such a device may be described as bioactive. Note 6: Wholly or mainly absorbed: The term absorption refers to the degradation of a material within the body and the metabolic elimination of the resulting degradation products from the body. Note 7: The concept of "potentially hazardous manner" is related to the characteristics of the device and not the competence of the user.

Rule 7 pertains to surgically invasive devices intended for short-term use, defined as more than 60 minutes but less than 30 days. These devices are typically employed during surgeries or in post-operative care, such as clamps and drains, as well as in various types of infusion devices like cannulae and needles, and different catheters. According to Rule 7, all surgically invasive devices intended for short-term use fall under Class IIa, except in specific circumstances where they are classified differently. If the device is specifically designed to control, diagnose, monitor, or correct a defect of the heart or the central circulatory system through direct contact with these areas of the body, it is classified as Class III. This includes cardiovascular catheters, cardiac output probes, temporary pacemaker leads, thoracic catheters intended to drain the heart, including the pericardium, carotid artery shunts, and ablation catheters. Devices intended for use in direct contact with the central nervous system are also classified as Class III and include neurological catheters and cortical electrodes. If a device is intended to supply energy in the form of ionizing radiation, it is categorized as Class IIb, with brachytherapy devices being an example. Devices meant to have a biological effect or that are wholly or mainly absorbed are classified as Class III, such as absorbable sutures and biological adhesives. Finally, devices intended to undergo chemical change in the body, unless they are placed in the teeth, or those intended to administer medicines are classified as Class IIb, like adhesives. Understanding these categories is important for the practical classification of medical devices.

Note 1: Administration of medicines is more than just channelling, it implies also storage and/or influencing the volume and rate of the medicine delivered. Implanted capsules for the slow release of medicines are medicines and not medical devices. Note 2: The expression “correct a defect” does not cover devices that are used accessorily in heart surgery, e.g. tissue stabilisers.

Rule 8 pertains to implantable devices and long-term surgically invasive devices lasting more than 30 days, primarily in fields like orthopaedics, dentistry, ophthalmology, and cardiovascular specialties, including soft tissue implants used in plastic surgery. According to Rule 8, all implantable devices and long-term surgically invasive devices fall into Class IIb unless specified otherwise. They are classified in Class IIa if intended for placement in the teeth. Examples include bridges and crowns, dental filling materials and pins, and dental alloys, ceramics, and polymers. For devices intended for use in direct contact with the heart, central circulatory system, or central nervous system, they are classified as Class III. Examples here encompass prosthetic heart valves, aneurysm clips, vascular prostheses and stents, central vascular catheters, spinal stents, CNS electrodes, cardiovascular sutures, permanent and retrievable vena cava filters, septal occlusion devices, and intra-aortic balloon pumps. Class IIb examples include prosthetic joint replacements not governed by Directive 2005/50/EC, ligaments, shunts, stents and valves (such as pulmonary ones), nails and plates, intra-ocular lenses, internal closure devices (including vascular closure devices), tissue augmentation implants, peripheral vascular catheters, peripheral vascular grafts and stents, penile implants, non-absorbable sutures, bone cements and maxillo-facial implants, as well as visco-elastic surgical devices intended specifically for ophthalmic anterior segment surgery.

External left ventricular assisting devices are categorized under certain classifications based on their biological effects, absorption, or chemical changes in the body. Devices that predominantly have a biological effect, are mainly absorbed, or undergo chemical change in the body, except for those placed in the teeth or used to administer medicines, are placed in Class III. This includes absorbable sutures, adhesives, and implantable devices with bioactive surface coatings such as phosphorylcholine, and rechargeable non-active drug delivery systems. Directive 2003/12/EC specifically reclassified breast implants to Class III, and Directive 2005/50/EC did the same for hip, knee, and shoulder joint replacements. The practical issues of classification indicate that significant substance remaining at a surgical site categorizes products as implants, which are treated under Rule 17 if they contain animal tissues. For arteriotomy closures in the peripheral vascular system, a different rule applies. Implants without bioactive coatings for teeth or prostheses are generally in Class IIb unless hydroxyapatite is specifically proven to have biological effects. Notably, the chemical change clause does not apply to products like bone cements where changes occur only during placement. For more detailed guidance, see the document available at [EU Medical Devices Guide](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/medical-devices/files/guide-stds-directives/final_reclass_note_12jan2007_en.pdf).

Rule 9 underlines the classification of active therapeutic devices intended for administering or exchanging energy, primarily in medical contexts. These devices are predominantly electrical equipment utilized in surgical settings, including lasers and surgical generators. Additionally, devices used for specialized treatments, such as those for radiation therapy, fall under this rule. Some stimulation devices are also covered, although not all are considered capable of delivering hazardous energy levels, depending on the tissue involved. According to Rule 9, all active therapeutic devices designed for energy administration or exchange are categorized as Class IIa. Examples include devices utilizing electrical, magnetic, or electromagnetic energy such as muscle stimulators, external bone growth stimulators, TENS devices, eye electromagnets, and electrical acupuncture. In the realm of thermal energy, devices like cryosurgery equipment and heat exchangers—excluding certain types—are included. Mechanical energy devices encompass powered dermatomes, powered drills, and dental handpieces. For light energy, devices like phototherapy equipment for skin treatment and neonatal care are listed, while hearing aids exemplify sound energy devices. Ultrasound equipment used in physiotherapy is also mentioned, unless these devices possess characteristics that enable them to administer or exchange kinetic energy.

Energy to and from the human body can potentially be hazardous, requiring classification based on the nature, density, and application site of the energy, with such cases falling into Class IIb. This includes devices like lung ventilators. Devices using thermal energy such as incubators for babies, warming blankets, blood warmers, and electrically powered heat exchangers (particularly those used with patients unable to react, communicate, or feel) also fall under this classification. Electrical energy devices include high-frequency electrosurgical generators, electrocautery equipment and their electrodes, external pacemakers and defibrillators, and electroconvulsive therapy equipment. Devices emitting coherent light, such as surgical lasers, and those using ultrasound like lithotriptors and surgical ultrasound devices, also belong to this class. Furthermore, devices utilizing ionizing radiation, including radioactive sources for afterloading therapy, therapeutic cyclotrons and linear accelerators, and therapeutic X-ray sources, are considered Class IIb. All active devices intended to control or monitor the performance of active therapeutic devices in Class IIb, or that directly influence their performance, are also classified as Class IIb. This includes external feedback systems for active therapeutic devices and afterloading control devices.

to be CE marked, except for custom-made devices and devices intended for clinical investigation, in which case they should comply with the provisions of Annex VIII of Directive 93/42/EEC regarding the statement on devices for special purposes. Conformity assessment is the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that their devices comply with the requirements of Directive 93/42/EEC. The classification of the medical device will have an impact on the conformity assessment route that the manufacturer should follow in order to affix the CE marking on the medical device. Conformity assessment procedures include various annexes. For Annexes I Sterile and I Measure, both Annex II (+ section 4) and Annex IV apply, while Annex V applies only to non-measuring devices. For Class IIa devices, Annex II (+ section 4), Annex II (- section 4), and Annex VI are relevant. For Class IIb devices, Annex II (- section 4) and Annex VI apply. Class III devices follow Annex III exclusively. Technical documentation relating to products in class IIa and class IIb must be reviewed by a notified body on the basis of a programme of representative sampling in the context of Annexes II, V, and VI of Directive 93/42/EEC. As part of the Essential Requirements, a clinical evaluation in accordance with Annex X must be conducted for all medical devices, per Annex I part I, 6a of Directive 93/42/EEC.

Note 1: The decision as to whether a medical device administers or exchanges energy to and from the human body in a potentially hazardous way should take into account the following factors. The concept of "potentially hazardous" is dependent on the type of technology involved and the intended application of the device to the patient and not on the measures adopted by the manufacturer in view of good design management (e.g. use of technical standards, risk analysis). For instance, all devices intended to emit ionizing radiation, all lung ventilators, and lithotriptors should be in Class IIb. However, the manufacturer's obligation to comply with design requirements and solutions adopted, such as use of standards, exists independently from the classification system.

Rule 10 - Active devices for diagnosis primarily covers a whole range of widely used equipment in various fields, such as ultrasound diagnosis, capture of physiological signals, and therapeutic and diagnostic radiology. Active devices intended for diagnosis are classified as Class IIa when they are intended to supply energy absorbed by the human body, except for devices used to illuminate the patient’s body in the visible spectrum. Examples include magnetic resonance equipment, pulp testers, evoked response stimulators, and diagnostic ultrasound. They are also in Class IIa if they are intended to image the in vivo distribution of radiopharmaceuticals, such as gamma cameras and positron emission tomography and single photon emission computer tomography. Devices intended to allow direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes are also in Class IIa unless they are specifically intended for monitoring vital physiological parameters where variations could result in immediate danger to the patient, like variations in cardiac performance, respiration, or CNS activity. In such cases, they are classified as Class IIb, including examples like intensive care monitoring and alarm devices (e.g., blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation), biological sensors, blood gas analyzers used in open heart surgery, cardioscopes, and apnea monitors, including those in home care. Active devices intended to emit ionizing radiation and intended for diagnostic and therapeutic interventional radiology, including those that control or monitor such devices or directly influence their performance, are classified as Class IIb. For example, diagnostic X-ray sources fall under this category.

Examples of special concepts include vital physiological processes and parameters such as respiration, heart rate, cerebral functions, blood gases, blood pressure, and body temperature. Medical devices used for continuous surveillance of these processes in anaesthesia, intensive care, or emergency care are classified as Class IIb, while devices for obtaining readings during routine check-ups and self-monitoring are classified as Class IIa. It's important to note that a thermal imaging device intended to monitor blood flow is not considered a temperature measuring device. Devices specifically intended to monitor AIMDs fall under the AIMD Directive. Therapeutic interventional radiology involves diagnosis during surgical procedures. Additionally, note that the term refers to active devices for controlling, monitoring, or influencing the emission of ionizing and not to the processes of subsequent image processing, recording, or viewing.

Rule 11 pertains to active devices intended to administer and/or remove medicines, body liquids, or other substances to or from the body. This rule primarily concerns drug delivery systems and anesthesia equipment. According to Rule 11, all active devices designed for administering and/or removing medicines, body fluids, or other substances to or from the body fall under Class IIa. Examples of devices in Class IIa include suction equipment, feeding pumps, jet injectors for vaccination, and nebulisers used on conscious and spontaneously breathing patients where failure to deliver the appropriate dosage characteristics is not potentially hazardous. However, if the administration or removal is done in a potentially hazardous manner—considering the nature of the substances, the part of the body involved, and the mode of application—such devices are categorized in Class IIb. Examples of devices in Class IIb include infusion pumps, ventilators, anesthesia machines, anesthetic vaporisers, dialysis equipment, blood pumps for heart-lung machines, hyperbaric chambers, pressure regulators for medical gases, medical gas mixers, moisture exchangers in breathing circuits when used on unconscious or non-spontaneously breathing patients, and nebulisers where the failure to deliver the appropriate dosage characteristics could be hazardous.

Rule 12 serves as a fallback rule to encompass all active devices not addressed by preceding rules. According to Rule 12, all other active devices are classified under Class I. Examples of such devices include active diagnostic devices intended to illuminate the patient's body in the visible spectrum, such as examination lights, or to optically view the body, such as surgical microscopes. It also covers devices generally intended for external patient support, including hospital beds, patient hoists, wheelchairs, and dental patient chairs. Additionally, active diagnostic devices intended for thermography and dental curing lights fall under this rule.

Rule 13 pertains to devices that incorporate, as an integral part, a medicinal product or a human blood derivative. This rule specifically addresses combination devices that contain a medicinal substance for assisting the device's function. It does not apply to devices containing substances that could be considered medicinal under different circumstances if these substances are used solely to maintain device characteristics without acting on the body. The device's main function should not depend on the medicine's pharmacological, metabolic, or immunological effects; otherwise, the product would be classified as a medicinal product. Under Rule 13, any device incorporating a substance considered a medicinal product per Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, which acts on the human body as a secondary action to the device, falls under Class III. Examples include antibiotic bone cements, condoms with spermicide, heparin-coated catheters, endodontic materials with antibiotics, ophthalmic irrigation solutions intended mainly for irrigation but containing components aiding corneal endothelial cell metabolism, dressings with antimicrobial agents providing secondary wound action, contraceptive intrauterine devices with copper or silver, and drug-eluting stents such as coronary or pulmonary. Devices incorporating a human blood derivative as an integral part are also classified under Class III, such as surgical sealants containing human serum albumin. "Integral part" means that the device and medicinal substance are physically or chemically combined when administered to the patient.

Rule 14 - Devices used for contraception or prevention of sexually transmitted diseases provide a general explanation of the rule. These intended uses relate to special cases of human vulnerability that cannot be covered by the normal criteria of time, invasiveness, and organic function. Although this rule covers two very different device applications, some devices may perform both functions, for example, condoms. Devices intended to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV are also covered by this rule. All devices used for contraception or the prevention of the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are in Class IIb, such as condoms and contraceptive diaphragms, unless they are implantable or long-term invasive devices, in which case they are in Class III, like contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUDs). Note 1 states that intrauterine contraceptives whose primary purpose is to release progestogens are not medical devices, as outlined in Article 1.3, 2nd paragraph of this Directive.

Rule 15 - Specific disinfecting, cleaning and rinsing devices is principally intended to cover various contact lens fluids and also covers substances and other equipment used principally in a medical environment to disinfect medical devices.

All devices intended specifically to be used for disinfecting, cleaning, rinsing, or, when appropriate, hydrating contact lenses are in Class IIb. Examples include contact lens solutions and comfort solutions.

All devices intended specifically to be used for disinfecting medical devices are in Class IIa. Examples include disinfectants specifically intended for non-invasive medical devices and equipment such as sterilizers specifically intended to sterilize medical devices in a medical environment and washer disinfectors; and washers-disinfectors intended specifically for disinfecting non-invasive medical devices, unless they are specifically to be used for disinfecting invasive devices in which case they are in Class IIb. Examples of these include denture disinfecting products, washers-disinfectors for endoscopes, disinfectants for the fluid pathways of haemodialysis equipment, and disinfectants for ocular prosthesis, intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthesis, surgical equipment, and invasive dental equipment. 

This rule does not apply to products that are intended to clean medical devices other than contact lenses by means of physical action. Practical issues of classification include Note 1, which states that this rule does not apply to mechanical means of cleaning devices, such as brushes and ultrasound. Such products will only fall under this Directive if they are specifically intended for use with medical devices.

Rule 16 - Devices to record X-ray diagnostic images Devices specifically intended for recording of X-ray diagnostic images are in Class IIa. Examples: - X-ray films - Photostimulable phosphor plates Note: This refers to primary recording media such as X-ray films and not to media used for subsequent reproduction.

Rule 17 - Devices utilizing animal tissues or derivatives covers devices that contain or are made of animal tissues that have been rendered non-viable or derivatives from such tissues also being non-viable, meaning there is no longer any capacity for cellular metabolic activity. Devices containing viable animal tissues and/or any human tissues or derivatives are excluded from the scope of this Directive. Further information on this issue can be found in MEDDEV 2.11/1 rev.2. The manufacture of some devices may use industrial raw materials which contain small amounts of tallow or tallow derivatives (e.g., stearates in polymers). Such substances are not considered as derivatives of animal tissues for the purpose of this rule which therefore does not apply. Rule 17 states that all devices manufactured utilizing animal tissues or derivatives rendered non-viable are Class III except where such devices are intended to come into contact with intact skin only. Examples include biological heart valves, porcine xenograft dressings, implants and dressings made from collagen, and devices utilizing hyaluronic acid of animal origin. 

Practical classification issues include devices made of non-viable animal tissue that come into contact with intact skin only, such as leather components of orthopedic appliances, which are classified as Class I in accordance with Rule 1. Note 1 specifies that derivatives are products processed from animal tissues and exclude substances such as milk, silk, beeswax, hair, and lanolin. Note 2 clarifies that intact skin includes the skin around an established stoma unless the skin is breached.

The Medical Devices Directive states in Annex X that as a general rule confirmation of conformity with the requirements concerning the characteristics and performances referred to in sections 1 and 3 of Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC under the normal conditions of use of the device and the evaluation of the undesirable side-effects must be based on clinical data. In addition, according to Annex X Section 1.1a of Directive 93/42/EEC “in the case of implantable devices and devices in class III clinical investigations shall be performed unless it is duly justified to rely on existing clinical data.” For further guidance on clinical evaluation see MEDDEV 2.7.1 Rev. 3^4. Pursuant to article 15.1, in case of devices intended for clinical investigations, the manufacturer shall notify the Competent Authorities of the Member States in which the investigations are to be conducted in accordance with section 2.2 of Annex VIII. Clinical investigations with Class III devices and implantable and long-term invasive devices falling within Class IIa or IIb may start 60 days after the manufacturer's notification to the Competent Authority unless the Competent Authority has notified a decision to the contrary based on considerations of public health or public policy within this timeframe (article 15.2). For further details see article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC. Instructions for use are not required for Class I and IIa devices if these devices can be used safely without any such instructions (Annex I Section 13.1 of Directive 93/42/EEC). The manufacturer of a Class I medical device, or his relevant authorised representative in the European Union designated by him, must notify their address and a description of the devices concerned to the Competent Authority of the Member State where they have their registered place of business (Article 14, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Directive 93/42/EEC). For medical devices of classes IIa, IIb and III, Member States may request to be informed of all data allowing for identification of such devices together with the label and the instructions for use when such devices are put into service within their territory (second sub-paragraph of Article 14, paragraph 1, of Directive 93/42/EEC). 

Rule 18 pertains specifically to blood bags, placing them in Class IIb through a derogation from other rules. This includes blood bags that contain or are coated with an anticoagulant. However, if the blood bags serve a function beyond storage, such as incorporating systems for preservation other than anticoagulants, additional rules like Rule 13 might apply. It is important to note that blood bags are described in the European Pharmacopoeia monograph on "Containers for Blood and Blood Components."

The manufacturer should first decide if the product concerned is a medical device as defined in Directive 93/42/EEC or an accessory to such a medical device, if it is not excluded from the scope of this Directive and if it therefore comes within the scope of this Directive. The classification rules are based on different criteria such as the duration of contact with the patient, the degree of invasiveness, and the part of the body affected by the use of the device. Intended purpose is defined in Article 1 paragraph 2(g) of Directive 93/42/EEC. The other terms are defined in chapter I section 1 of Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC. These definitions are reproduced below, together with some additional guidance. ‘Intended purpose” means the use for which the device is intended according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the labelling, in the instructions and/or in promotional materials. Normally intended for continuous use for less than 60 minutes is considered Transient. Normally intended for continuous use for not more than 30 days is known as Short term. Long term refers to devices normally intended for continuous use for more than 30 days.

In certain instances, the duration of effect for a product needs to be considered as the duration of use. For instance, application of a topical cream to the skin may only take seconds to apply but the cream may remain in situ for many hours. The duration of use should therefore not be considered as the time taken to apply the product but rather the duration for which the product achieves its intended purpose. In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1.1 of Chapter I of Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, continuous use means "an uninterrupted actual use of the device for the intended purpose. However where usage of a device is discontinued in order for the device to be replaced immediately by the same or an identical device this shall be considered as an extension of the continuous use of the device" (Section 2.6 of Chapter II of Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC). For example, a scalpel may be used on the same patient throughout an operation that may last for several hours. The uninterrupted use for an intended purpose, i.e. cutting tissue, will normally not last for more than a few seconds at a time. Therefore a scalpel is a transient use device. However where usage of a device is discontinued in order for the device to be replaced immediately by the same or an identical device (e.g. replacement of a ureteric catheter) this shall be considered an extension of the continuous use of the device. If it cannot be demonstrated that components of the device are totally eliminated in the interval between uses, this is also considered as an immediate replacement. An invasive device is a device which, in whole or in part, penetrates inside the body, either through a body orifice or through the surface of the body. A body orifice is any natural opening in the body, as well as the external surface of the eyeball, or any permanent artificial opening, such as a stoma. A surgically invasive device penetrates inside the body through the surface of the body, with the aid of or in the context of a surgical operation. For the purposes of this Directive, devices other than those referred to in the previous subparagraph and which produce penetration other than through an established body orifice shall be treated as surgically invasive devices. The term surgical operation used in this definition includes all clinical interventional procedures in which a device is placed into the body through the surface in the context of a surgical operation or other clinical procedure.

In this context, it should be noted the following: A surgically created stoma used in urostomy, colostomy, and ileostomy or permanent tracheostomy is considered to be a body orifice. Therefore, devices introduced into such a stoma are not surgically invasive. A surgically created opening to allow access to the circulatory system, in contrast, should not be considered to be such a "body orifice". Devices introduced into such an opening are surgically invasive. A device that administers energy to the body should not be considered as invasive if only energy penetrates the body and not the device itself. Energy as such is not a device and therefore it cannot be classified. Only the device generating the energy must be classified. However, if a device administers a substance, whether this substance is a medicine or a medical device, such a substance must be assessed in its own right (e.g., substances administered by a jet injector). Any device which, in whole or in part, penetrates inside the body, either through a natural body orifice or through the surface of the body, is an invasive device. A surgically invasive device always implies that it enters through an artificially created opening. This can be a large opening, such as a surgical incision, or it can be a pinprick opening created by a needle. Therefore, surgical gloves and needles used with syringes are surgically invasive. The concept of surgically invasive should be understood as covering also liquids that are in invasive contact with organs, tissue, or other parts of the body if the access for such liquids is through a surgically created opening. Reusable surgical instrument is an instrument intended for surgical use by cutting, drilling, sawing, scratching, scraping, clamping, retracting, clipping or similar procedures, without connection to any active medical device and which can be reused after appropriate procedures have been carried out (Section 1.3 of Annex IX of Directive 93/42/EEC). An implantable device is any device which is intended to be totally introduced into the human body or to replace an epithelial surface or the surface of the eye by surgical intervention which is intended to remain in place after the procedure. Any device intended to be partially introduced into the human body through surgical intervention and intended to remain in place after the procedure for at least 30 days is also considered an implantable device.

One of the key elements in defining an implantable device is the concept of "procedure". Thus, an implantable device must remain in the patient after the procedure. A "procedure" must be understood in this context to include the surgical procedure during which the implant is placed into the body and the immediate post-operative care that is associated with the procedure. The "procedure" does not extend to the conclusion of the therapeutic treatment, e.g., the removal of an implant must be considered to be another "procedure". Thus, a plate used to reduce a fracture of the bone is an implant even if it is taken out after the fracture has healed. In this case, the placing of the plate and its explantation are two different surgical procedures. Some partially implanted devices are deemed to be implants. For instance, if an operation is carried out specifically to place an infusion port into the body, then such an infusion port would remain for at least 30 days after the procedure and consequently be an implant. However, a non-tunnelled central venous catheter which is intended for use for temporary vascular access and intended to be removed after 7 – 10 days is not a long-term implantable device. Nor would a suture used for skin wound closure that is taken out prior to 30 days be considered an implant. For the purposes of the Directive 93/42/EEC, 'central circulatory system' means the following vessels: arteriae pulmonales, aorta ascendens, arcus aorta, aorta descendens to the bifurcatio aortae, arteriae coronariae, arteria carotis communis, arteria carotis externa, arteria carotis interna, arteriae cerebrales, truncus brachiocephalicus, venae cordis, venae pulmonales, vena cava superior, vena cava inferior. For the purposes of the Directive 93/42/EEC the 'central nervous system' means brain, meninges and spinal cord. Any medical device operation of which depends on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity and which acts by converting this energy. Medical devices intended to transmit energy, substances or other elements between an active medical device and the patient, without any significant change, are not considered to be active medical devices. Stand-alone software is considered to be an active medical device. The concept "act by converting energy" includes conversion of energy in the device and/or conversion at the interface between the device and the tissues or in the tissues.
